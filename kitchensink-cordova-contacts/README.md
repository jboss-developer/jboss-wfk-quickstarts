kitchensink-cordova-contacts: Example Mobile Applications Using Hybrid HTML5 + REST with Apache Cordova
===============================================================================================
Author: Vineet Reynolds  
Level: Intermediate  
Technologies: HTML5, REST, Apache Cordova  
Summary: Based on kitchensink, but uses hybrid HTML5 running as a native application on mobiles  
Target Product: WFK  
Product Versions: EAP 6.1, EAP 6.2, WFK 2.5  
Source: <https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-wfk-quickstarts/>  

What is it?
-----------

This project serves as an example of the HTML5 [kitchensink](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-wfk-quickstarts/tree/master/kitchensink-backbone) quickstart converted to a hybrid [Apache Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org/) application. It demonstrates the use of the Cordova Contacts API and extends the kitchensink example to do so.

What does this mean? Basically, this takes our [HTML5 + REST](http://www.jboss.org/jdf/quickstarts/jboss-as-quickstart/wfk-quickstarts/kitchensink-backbone/) / [jQuery Mobile](http://jquerymobile.com/) web application and converts it to a native application for both iOS and Android.

These concepts can be applied to the conversion of most HTML5/JS based web apps by just replacing the specific paths described in this article with paths that match your environment.  The existing web application is also enhanced with Cordova plugins to utilize device features through JavaScript APIs. This example uses the following plugins:

- the Device plugin to describe the device hardware and software,
- the Dialogs and Vibration plugins to alert users of events through visible, audible or tactile notifications,
- the Statusbar plugin to manipulate the statusbar on iOS devices, and
- the Contacts plugin to access and modify the contacts stored on the device.

Kitchensink Apache Cordova Contacts iOS Example
-----------------------------------------------

### What is it?

This quickstart was built upon the HTML5 kitchensink quickstart, which was converted to an Apache Cordova based Hybrid Mobile application. Basically, this takes our HTML5 + REST / jQuery Mobile based web application and converts it to a native application for iOS.

### System requirements

The application this project produces is designed to be run on Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (EAP) 6.1 or later with the Red Hat JBoss Web Framework Kit (WFK) 2.5.

All you need to build this project is Java 6.0 (Java SDK 1.6) or later, the iOS SDK and JBDS 7 with [JBoss Hybrid Mobile Tools + CordovaSim](http://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/eclipse-adt.html) installed. The iOS SDK is available as part of Apple XCode. If you need more detailed instructions to setup JBDS 7 with JBoss Hybrid Mobile Tools + CordovaSim, you can take a look at the user guide to [Install Hybrid Mobile Tools and CordovaSim](https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_JBoss_Developer_Studio/7.1/html/User_Guide/Install_Hybrid_Mobile_Tools_and_CordovaSim.html).


### Import the Quickstart Code

First we need to import the existing code to JBDS

1. In JBDS, click on `File`, then `Import`.
2. Select `General` --> `Existing Projects into Workspace` and click `Next`.
3. In `Select root directory`, click on the `Browse...` button, then find and select `QUICKSTART_HOME/kitchensink-cordova-contacts/`. Be sure to replace `QUICKSTART_HOME` with the root directory of your quickstarts.
4. Click the `Finish` button to start the project import.


### Deploy and Access the application 

1. Select your project in JBDS.
2. Click on `Run`, then `Run As` and `Run on iOS Simulator`.

The iOS simulator will started, and the application will be deployed and run on it.

### What is it?

This application is built upon the HTML5 kitchensink quickstart, which was converted to an Apache Cordova based Hybrid Mobile application. Basically, this takes our HTML5 + REST / jQuery Mobile based web application and converts it to a native application for Android. 

### System requirements

All you need to build this project is Java 6.0 (Java SDK 1.6) or later, the Android SDK and JBDS 7 with [JBoss Hybrid Mobile Tools + CordovaSim](http://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/eclipse-adt.html) and the Android Development Tools plugin from Google. If you need more detailed instructions to setup JBDS 7 with JBoss Hybrid Mobile Tools + CordovaSim, you can take a look at the user guide to [Install Hybrid Mobile Tools and CordovaSim](https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_JBoss_Developer_Studio/7.1/html/User_Guide/Install_Hybrid_Mobile_Tools_and_CordovaSim.html).
