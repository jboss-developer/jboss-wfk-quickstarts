<h2><a id="what-is-it" class="anchor" href="#what-is-it"><span class="anchor-icon"></span></a>What is it?</h2>

<p>This is your project! It is a sample, deployable Maven 3 project to help you get your foot in the door developing with Java EE 6 on Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.2 or later.</p>

<p>This project is setup to allow you to create a compliant Java EE 6 application using JSF 2.0 with RichFaces 4, CDI 1.0, EJB 3.1, JPA 2.0 and Bean Validation 1.0. It includes a persistence unit and some sample persistence and transaction code to introduce you to database access in enterprise Java.</p>

<p>This application builds on top of the standard JSF approach, by incorporating the RichFaces project to provide a set of components, allowing for a rich user experience.  RichFaces builds on top of the JSF standard, and is a fully portable solution compatible with all JSF implementations.</p>

<p>The kitchensink quickstart is built using Vanilla JSF for its front end.  With this kitchensink-rf quickstart, we build on top of the JSF user interface, augmenting it with RichFaces JSF components and capabilities.  Some key points to make note of while running the application:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Ajax push: This application makes use of ajax push.  When a member is created in one browser, the member list is updated in <strong>all</strong> open browsers.</p>

<p>Try this yourself, by opening two different browsers, create a new member in one browser, and watch for the list to be updated in both browsers.</p></li>
<li><p>Ajax: All page updates are made with an ajax call, increasing the page responsiveness, and leading to a more native <strong>feeling</strong> application.</p></li>
<li><p>Client-side validation: By simply nesting a <rich:validator /> tag in the input elements, we wire them with RichFaces client-side validation capabilities.  The inputs are validated locally using javascript, without requiring a round-trip to the server.</p></li>
<li><p>Popups: Click the view link next to a member in the member list to view a popup with the member details.  To close the popup, click the &ldquo;X&rdquo; in the top right-hand corner, or click anywhere on the background mask.</p></li>
<li><p>Mobile support: view the application form a webkit powered browser on a mobile device to try out the mobile version of the application.  Alternatively, view the mobile version on your desktop by navigating to the url: <a href="http://localhost:8080/jboss-kitchensink-rf/mobile/">http://localhost:8080/jboss-kitchensink-rf/mobile/</a></p></li>
</ul>

<h2><a id="build-and-deploy-the-quickstart" class="anchor" href="#build-and-deploy-the-quickstart"><span class="anchor-icon"></span></a>Build and Deploy the Quickstart</h2>

<p><em>NOTE: The following build command assumes you have configured your Maven user settings. If you have not, you must include Maven setting arguments on the command line. See <a href="../README.html#build-and-deploy-the-quickstarts">Build and Deploy the Quickstarts</a> for complete instructions and additional options.</em></p>

<ol>
<li>Make sure you have started the JBoss EAP server as described above.</li>
<li>Open a command line and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.</li>
<li><p>Type this command to build and deploy the archive:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">mvn</span> <span class="n">clean</span> <span class="n">package</span> <span class="n">jboss</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">as</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="n">deploy</span>
</pre></div></li>
<li><p>This will deploy <code>target/jboss-kitchensink-rf.war</code> to the running instance of the server.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2><a id="access-the-application" class="anchor" href="#access-the-application"><span class="anchor-icon"></span></a>Access the application</h2>

<h2><a id="run-the-arquillian-tests" class="anchor" href="#run-the-arquillian-tests"><span class="anchor-icon"></span></a>Run the Arquillian Tests</h2>

<p>This quickstart provides Arquillian tests. By default, these tests are configured to be skipped as Arquillian tests require the use of a container.</p>

<p><em>NOTE: The following commands assume you have configured your Maven user settings. If you have not, you must include Maven setting arguments on the command line. See <a href="../README.html#run-the-arquillian-tests">Run the Arquillian Tests</a> for complete instructions and additional options.</em></p>

<ol>
<li>Make sure you have started the JBoss EAP server as described above.</li>
<li>Open a command line and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.</li>
<li><p>Type the following command to run the test goal with the following profile activated:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">mvn</span> <span class="n">clean</span> <span class="n">test</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">Parq</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">jbossas</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">remote</span>

</ol>

<h2><a id="run-the-arquillian-functional-tests" class="anchor" href="#run-the-arquillian-functional-tests"><span class="anchor-icon"></span></a>Run the Arquillian Functional Tests</h2>

<p>This quickstart provides Arquillian functional tests as well. They are located in the functional-tests/ subdirectory under the root directory of this quickstart.
Functional tests verify that your application behaves correctly from the user&rsquo;s point of view. The tests open a browser instance, simulate clicking around the page as a normal user would do, and then close the browser instance.</p>

<p>To run these tests, you must build the main project as described above.</p>

<ol>
<li>Open a command line and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.</li>
<li><p>Build the quickstart WAR using the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">mvn</span> <span class="n">clean</span> <span class="n">package</span>
</pre></div></li>
<li><p>Navigate to the functional-tests/ directory in this quickstart.</p></li>
<li><p>If you have a running instance of the JBoss EAP server, as described above, run the remote tests by typing the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">mvn</span> <span class="n">clean</span> <span class="n">verify</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">Parq</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">jbossas</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">remote</span>
</pre></div></li>
<li><p>If you prefer to run the functional tests using managed instance of the JBoss EAP server, meaning the tests will start the server for you, type fhe following command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">mvn</span> <span class="n">clean</span> <span class="n">verify</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">Parq</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">jbossas</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">managed</span>
