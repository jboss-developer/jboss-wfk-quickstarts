<cheatsheet title="JSF 2.0 + RichFaces + CDI: Kitchensink RichFaces Mobile quickstart">
  <intro>
    <description>
      This quickstart is based on the kichensink quickstart. It starts with the basic JSF front end, but adds RichFaces components to allow for a rich user experience. RichFaces builds on top of the JSF standard, and is a fully portable solution compatible with all JSF implementations. Some key points to make note of while running the application:
      <br/><br/>
      <b>AJAX Push</b>
      <br/><br/>
       This application makes use of AJAX push.  When a member is created in one browser, the member list is updated in all open browsers. Try this yourself by opening two different browsers. Create a new member in one browser and watch for the list to be updated in both browsers.
      <br/><br/>
      <b>AJAX Calls</b>
      <br/><br/>
      All page updates are made with an AJAX call, which increases the page responsiveness.
      <br/><br/>
      <b>Client-side Validation</b>
      <br/><br/>
      By simply nesting a &#60;rich:validator /&#62; tag in the input elements, we wire them with RichFaces client-side validation capabilities.  The inputs are validated locally using JavaScript, which does not require a round-trip to the server.
      <br/><br/>
      <b>Popups</b>
      <br/><br/>
      Click the view link next to a member in the member list to view a popup with the member details.  To close the popup, click the "X" in the top right-hand corner, or click anywhere on the background mask.
      <br/><br/>
      <b>Mobile Support</b>
      <br/><br/>
      View the application on a mobile device to try out the mobile version of the application.  Alternatively, view the mobile version on your desktop by navigating to the url: http://localhost:8080/jboss-kitchensink-rf/mobile/

    <description>
      The kitchensink-rf application shows off a number of Java EE technologies such as RichFaces, AJAX, JSF 2.0, CDI 1.0, EJB 3.1, JPA 2.0, Bean Validation 1.0, and Arquillian.

      The <b>kitchensink-rf quickstart</b> is generated from a Maven archetype. 
      Using this archetype offers you the perfect opportunity to generate your own project.
      <br/><br/>
      To generate your own RichFaces application, select <b>Help&gt;JBoss Central</b> and click the <b>RichFaces Project</b> wizard.
      <br/>
      This creates brand new project with the same functionality as <b>kitchensink-rf</b>, 
      but customized with your details.
