What is it?
-----------


This is your project! It is a sample, deployable Maven 3 project to help you get your foot in the door developing with 
Java EE 6 and Spring on Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.1 or later.

This project is setup to allow you to create a compliant Java EE 6 application using JSP, JPA 2.0 and Spring 3.2. It 
includes a persistence unit and some sample persistence and transaction code to introduce you to database access in enterprise Java:

* In `jboss-as-spring-mvc-context.xml` `<context:component-scan base-package="org.jboss.as.quickstarts.kitchensink.spring.basic.controller"/>` and `<mvc:annotation-driven/>` are used to register both the non-rest and rest controllers.

* The controllers map the respective urls to methods using `@RequestMapping(url)`.

* To return JSON, the rest controller uses `@ResponseBody`.

* The datasource and entitymanager are retrieved via JNDI.

System Requirements
-------------------

The application this project produces is designed to be run on Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (EAP) 6.1 or 
later with the Red Hat JBoss Web Framework Kit (WFK) 2.4.

To run the quickstart with the provided build script, you need the following:

1. Java 1.6, to run JBoss and Maven. You can choose from the following:
    * OpenJDK
    * Oracle Java SE
    * Oracle JRockit

2. Maven 3.0.0 or later, to build and deploy the examples
    * If you have not yet installed Maven, see the [Maven Getting Started Guide](http://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/index.html) for details.
    * If you have installed Maven, you can check the version by typing the following in a command line:

            mvn --version 

3. The JBoss EAP distribution ZIP.
    * For information on how to install and run JBoss, refer to the product documentation.


Configure Maven
---------------

If you have not yet done so, you must [Configure Maven](../README.md#configure-maven) before testing the quickstarts.


Start the JBoss Server
-------------------------

1. Open a command line and navigate to the root of the JBoss server directory.
2. The following shows the command line to start the server:

        For Linux:   JBOSS_HOME/bin/standalone.sh
        For Windows: JBOSS_HOME\bin\standalone.bat

 
Build and Deploy the Quickstart
-------------------------

_NOTE: The following build command assumes you have configured your Maven user settings. If you have not, you must include Maven setting arguments on the command line. See [Build and Deploy the Quickstarts](../README.md#build-and-deploy-the-quickstarts) for complete instructions and additional options._

1. Make sure you have started the JBoss Server as described above.
2. Open a command line and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
3. Type this command to build and deploy the archive:

        mvn clean install jboss-as:deploy

4. This will deploy `target/jboss-spring-kitchensink-basic.war` to the running instance of the server.


Access the application
----------------------

The application will be running at the following URL: <http://localhost:8080/jboss-spring-kitchensink-basic/>.


Undeploy the Archive
--------------------

1. Make sure you have started the JBoss Server as described above.
2. Open a command line and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
3. When you are finished testing, type this command to undeploy the archive:

        mvn jboss-as:undeploy

Run the Arquillian Functional Tests
-----------------------------------

This quickstart provides Arquillian functional tests as well. They are located in the functional-tests/ subdirectory under the root directory of this quickstart.
Functional tests verify that your application behaves correctly from the user's point of view. The tests open a browser instance, simulate clicking around the page as a normal user would do, and then close the browser instance.

To run these tests, you must build the main project as described above.

1. Open a command line and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
2. Build the quickstart WAR using the following command:

        mvn clean package

3. Navigate to the functional-tests/ directory in this quickstart.
4. If you have a running instance of the JBoss Server, as described above, run the remote tests by typing the following command:

        mvn clean verify -Parq-jbossas-remote

5. If you prefer to run the functional tests using managed instance of the JBoss server, meaning the tests will start the server for you, type fhe following command:

        mvn clean verify -Parq-jbossas-managed

Run the Arquillian Tests 
-------------------------

This quickstart provides Arquillian tests. By default, these tests are configured to be skipped as Arquillian tests require the use of a container. 

_NOTE: The following commands assume you have configured your Maven user settings. If you have not, you must include Maven setting arguments on the command line. See [Run the Arquillian Tests](../README.md#run-the-arquillian-tests) for complete instructions and additional options._

1. Make sure you have started the JBoss Server as described above.
2. Open a command line and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
3. Type the following command to run the test goal with the following profile activated:

        mvn clean test -Parq-jbossas-remote 



Run the Quickstart in JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse
-------------------------------------

You can also start the server and deploy the quickstart from Eclipse using JBoss tools. For more information, see 
[Use JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse to Run the Quickstart](../README.md#use-jboss-developer-studio-or-eclipse-to-run-the-quickstarts)


Resolve ERRORs in JBDS/Eclipse
--------------------------------
If you only build with Maven command line, you should not see any errors. However, if you `Build` or `Build Automatically` 
with Eclipse, you will see some errors. The following lists the errors and how to fix them.
 
1.  `cvc-complex-type.2.4.a: Invalid content was found starting with element 'deployment'. One of '{ear-subdeployments-isolated, deployment, sub-deployment, module}' is expected.`
    *  Please ignore this error as it is due to a problem in the schema definition.  
2.  `Console configuration "" does not exist.`
    1.  Select the project 
    2.  Select the `Project` menu, then `Properties` -> `Hibernate Settings`
        1.  Look in the combo-box below the "Default Hibernate Console configuration:" label and select a console configuration. 
        2.  If no console configuration exists then Cancel and do the following.
            1.  Select `Run` -> `Run Configurations` 
            2.  Under `Hibernate Console Configuration` create a new Configuration
            3.  Enter the project name as the Name
            4.  In the "Database connection:" combo-box select "[JPA Project Configured Connection]"
            5.  Select `Apply`
            6.  Return to step 1 to select the configuration you just created.


Debug the Application
---------------------

If you want to debug the source code or look at the Javadocs of any library in the project, run either of the following 
commands to pull them into your local repository. The IDE should then detect them.

        mvn dependency:sources
        mvn dependency:resolve -Dclassifier=javadoc
